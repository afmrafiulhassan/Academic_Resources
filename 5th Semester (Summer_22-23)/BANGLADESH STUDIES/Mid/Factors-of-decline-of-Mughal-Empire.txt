(1) None of Aurangzeb successors could give stability to the empire. They were absolutely inefficient. 

(2) The Nobles took advantage of this situation and they enriched and strengthened themselves.

(3) Aurangzeb’s son Muajjan won the first round of succession war and ascended the throne under the name of Bahadur shah. He was very inefficient and after his death a quarrel took place among his four sons.

(4) The eldest, Jahandar Shah got the throne but was assassinated in 1713 and his nephew Farruksiyar was made emperor by two very influential brothers – the Sayyids. The Sayyid brother (Sayyid Hussain Ali and Sayyid Abdullah) were so influential that they could make or unmake everything. Farruksiyar was soon dragged down and killed and the Sayyids made Muhammad Shah emperor of Delhi.

(5) Muhammad Shah was pleasure-loving but he ruled for longer time than did his immediate predecessors. It was he who at last broke the power of the Sayyids. It was, moreover, in his reign that Nadir Shah of Persia invaded India in 1739 A.D.. He carried destruction everywhere. India hardly recovered from this shock. Muhammad shah died in 1748.

(6) During the next reign the different parts of the empire began to fall apart. Oudh or Ayodhya, Bengal and Hyderabad became independent. The two later emperors, Alamgir II and Shah Alam II, were powerless. The Mughal empire from that time remained just a name without any real power.
